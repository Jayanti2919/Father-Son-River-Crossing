# Father-Son-River-Crossing

The problem statement is as given below:
```
A father, his two sons, and a boat are on one side of a river. The capacity of boat is 100 kg. The father weighs 100 kg and each son weighs 50 kg. How can they get across the river? 
```
I have used Breadth First and Depth First search to determine the solution to this problem.
